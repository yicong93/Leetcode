# Write your MySQL query statement below
# one way:
delete p1
from Person p1, Person p2
where p1.Email=p2.Email and p1.Id>p2.Id;

# the other way:
delete
from Person
where Id not in 
(select * from (select min(Id) from Person group by Email) a);


# delete
# from Person
# where Id not in 
# (select min(Id) from Person group by Email);
# run error: You can't specify target table 'Person' for update in FROM clause.

# Wrong answers:

# select Email, min(Id) as Id
# from Person
# group by Email;

# Why wrong?
# Because the exercise wants you to physically DELETE the duplicate emails from the original table rather than just SELECTING the unique emails from it.
