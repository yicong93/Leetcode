MS SQL:

SELECT DISTINCT num as ConsecutiveNums
FROM
(
SELECT num,LEAD(num) OVER(ORDER BY id) AS lead, LAG(num) OVER (ORDER BY id) AS lag
FROM Logs
)t
WHERE num=lead and num=lag



Wrong answer:
Reason:This will not work if there are gaps in id values.

select distinct a.num as ConsecutiveNums
from Logs a
inner join Logs b on b.id=a.id+1 and b.num=a.num
inner join Logs c on c.id=a.id+2 and c.num=a.num;
