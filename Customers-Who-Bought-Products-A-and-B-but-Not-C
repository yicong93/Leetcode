Solution 1:
select o.customer_id, c.customer_name
from Orders o join Customers c on o.customer_id=c.customer_id
join Orders r on o.customer_id=r.customer_id and o.product_name='A' and r.product_name='B'
left join Orders d on r.customer_id=d.customer_id and d.product_name='C'
where d.product_name is null


Solution 2:
select c.customer_id, c.customer_name 
from Customers as c 
        join
        (select customer_id, 
        sum(CASE
        WHEN product_name = 'A' THEN 1
        WHEN product_name = 'B' THEN 1
        WHEN product_name = 'C' THEN -1
        ELSE 0 END) as tot   
    from Orders
    group by customer_id
    having tot=2) as o
where c.customer_id = o.customer_id
