# Write your MySQL query statement below
select distinct c.id,d.name
from
(select b.*,date_sub(b.login_date, interval b.ranks day) diff
from
(select a.id, a.login_date,row_number() over(partition by a.id order by login_date) ranks
from
(select distinct id, login_date
from Logins) a)b) c
join Accounts d on c.id=d.id
group by c.id,c.diff
having count(c.login_date)>=5
order by c.id;



# the idea is to group by the same difference between ranks and date
