# Write your MySQL query statement below
select round(min(sqrt(pow(p1.x-p2.x,2)+pow(p1.y-p2.y,2))),2) as shortest
from point_2d p1, point_2d p2
where p1.x!=p2.x or p1.y!=p2.y;




Optimize to avoid reduplicate calculations:

SELECT
    ROUND(SQRT(MIN(POW(p1.x - p2.x, 2) + POW(p1.y - p2.y, 2))),2) AS shortest
FROM
    point_2d p1
        JOIN
    point_2d p2 ON (p1.x <= p2.x AND p1.y < p2.y)
        OR (p1.x <= p2.x AND p1.y > p2.y)
        OR (p1.x < p2.x AND p1.y = p2.y)
;
