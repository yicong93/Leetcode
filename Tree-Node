Do not use NOT IN (collection) if there is NULL value in this collection. Instead, try to use IN!

x NOT IN (...) is defined as a series of comparisons between x and each of the values returned by the subquery. 
SQL uses three-value logic, for which the three possible values of a logical expression are true, false or unknown. 
Comparison of a value to a NULL is unknown and if any one of those NOT IN comparisons is unknown then the result is also deemed to be unknown.
