# Write your MySQL query statement below
select distinct t1.id, t1.visit_date, t1.people
from stadium t1, stadium t2, stadium t3
where t1.people>=100 and t2.people>=100 and t3.people>=100
and 
(
    (t1.id=t2.id-1 and t1.id=t3.id-2 and t2.id=t3.id-1)
    or
    (t1.id=t2.id+1 and t1.id=t3.id-1 and t2.id=t3.id-2)
    or 
    (t1.id=t2.id+1 and t1.id=t3.id+2 and t2.id=t3.id+1)
)
order by t1.id;



use Cartesian product and filter with some conditions,
considering t1, t2,t3 are indentical, we can take one of them to consider what conditions we should add to filter the data 
and get the final result. 
Taking t1 for example, it could exist in the beginning of the consecutive 3 days, or the middle, or the last.
